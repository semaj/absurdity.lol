    <h1>let's have fun on the web</h1>
    <p>hi. is anyone else not having much fun right now? </p>
    <p>the giant wall street happiness index is doing bad</p>
    <p>the big digital money and twitter machine is also not doing good</p>
    <p>also other things</p>
    <p>have you written any html lately though? it's pretty cool. you can make a website for free and write whatever you want whenever you want and share the link and make things look pretty much how ever you want.</p>
    <p style="color:darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">like look this is green and bold that is pretty cool. with css you can change the color and layout and more. it's a bit finicky but even when it doesn't look good it might just be interesting like art</p>
    <p>when's the last time you did something for no reason other than fun? maybe making websites isn't that fun for you and that's cool. but it can be fun to write your thoughts down and make them look neat and share them with people. html might just be a way for you to talk about whatever you find fun like plants. oh yeah you can share these websites with your friends with links</p>
    <p>i made <a href="https://coollinks.xyz" target="_blank">this website</a> the other day to show off some links i currently like. the css didn't do what i wanted it to but it kinda came out cool anyway</p>
    <p>you can also share these websites with your friends</p>
    <h2>it seems like a good time to go back to basics</h2>
    <p>making websites like this instead of really big ones is better for the environment since it uses less network bandwidth and requires less work by the computer to show up</p>
    <p>also it doesn't really cost anything and can be done on pretty much any computer that can run a web browser so it's very accessible</p>
    <p>and like we as humans weren't really meant to be part of global communities we're supposed to be part of small little communities and we can kinda emulate that but for fun!</p>
    <p>also you have a lot of control over what you write and how it looks. you can then email your website to your friends or even get friends to subscribe to your websites using rss so they can receive updates when you update your site</p>
    <p>and you don't need any fancy frameworks or anything like you can just open up notepad or whatever and then open the file in the browser and it works!</p>
    <p>if you wanna get really fancy you can also use javascript which is this pretty complicated language but you can use it for adding cool animations and stuff to your website</p>

    <h2>not web 1.0, web fun.0</h2>
    <p>people always talk about "web 1.0" and how it should come back but it's gone so let's make something new. like xmlhttprequest is here to stay ya know</p>
    <p> also web 2.0 and web 3.0 are taken so web fun.0 it is but let's not be dogmatic about it really</p>
    <p>we could carve out a new corner of the web that's focused on fun and honesty and expression and simplicity and being environmentally conscious</p>
    <p>heck you could just carve our your own corner with your friends where you can be yourselves and share cool html and css and javascript snippets or tips on how to write c or rust or prolog or lisp or how to read cool books or whatever</p>
    <h2>where do i start?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>you can make a super easy html website on <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">neocities</a>. there's also some great inspiration <a href="https://neocities.org/browse" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>you can also host free html websites on cloudflare and netlify and probably others</li>
      <li>right click on this page and click view source and then you can copy it and change it or do whatever that's called open source</li>
    </ul>
